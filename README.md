# Guess-My-Number-Mobile-App

<h3>Guess My Number is a React Native Mobile Game App where you choose a number and your phone guess what it is based on your hints</h3>

I created this app as a part of refreshing my knowledge by taking this course https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/, it is the second of 5 apps, and it dives deep into the built-in react native components stucture and how to use them to build your own thing
